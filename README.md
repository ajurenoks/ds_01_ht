# String Reversal Problem

Given a string `S`, the task is to print the reverse of the string as output.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`S = "RTU data structure course"`

**Output:**  
`"esruoc erutcurts atad UTR"`

**Explanation:**  
The element at the first position is at the last, and the last is at the first. The second element is at the second last position, and the second last is at the second position, and so on.

### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`S = "ReversE"`

**Output:**  
`"EsreveR"`

**Explanation:**  
"E" is at the first position and "R" at the last. "e" is at the second last and "s" at the second, and so on.

## Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function `revStr()` which takes `S` as an input parameter and returns the reversed string.

## Expected Time Complexity

O(|S|)

## Expected Auxiliary Space

O(|S|)

## Constraints

- 1 <= |S| <= 1000
